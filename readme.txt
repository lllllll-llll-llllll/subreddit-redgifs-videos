quick autoit script for scraping redgif videos from specified subreddits

instructions:
- create "subreddits.txt" in the same directory as "main.au3"
- add subreddit names (not urls) one per line into "subreddits.txt"
- run "main.au3"
- a "/videos" folder will be created in the same directory as "main.au3" and videos will be downloaded here
- videos that are downloaded will have their redgifs id marked as such in "downloaded.txt" so they aren't redownloaded
